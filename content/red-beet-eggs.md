- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 5 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 15 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 8

## Ingredients

- 2 large canning/mason jars
- 8 hard cooked eggs, peeled
- 1 16 oz can sliced beets
- 1 cup white sugar (150 gr)
- 1 cup apple cider vinegar (150 gr)
- 8 whole cloves
- 1 dried bay leaf
- ¬º teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch of pepper

## Directions

1. Empty juice from the can of beets into a 2 quart saucepan, placing the can with contents remaining aside.
2. Add 1 cup apple cider vinegar to saucepan.
3. Add 1 cup white sugar to saucepan.
4. Begin to stir all other ingredients, the cloves, bay leaf, salt, and pepper into saucepan while quickly bringing to a boil.
5. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. While the juice simmers, place a layer of the sliced beets you set aside into a mason jar, followed by 2-3 eggs.
7. Repeat these layers until the jar is evenly filled, with beets being the final addition on top.
8. Remove juice from heat and slowly pour into jars. A strainer or funnel may be helpful here to avoid staining messes.
9. Place a lid and ring on you mason jar and place in the fridge for no less than 3 days, althought I prefer somewhere around 1 week.

## Notes

- The most important thing is to ensure all of our ingredients, _especially the eggs_, are completely covered with the beet juice. This is where sweet onions come in handy to ensure the jar is packed full. In a pinvh, you may top off the last bit with water as well.
- The amount of cloves may be adjusted per your preference. I like 10-12 for 2 jars, but my mother thinks they are overpowering and prefers it with half that.
- I find it difficult to pour from a saucepan and you will certainly spill what is akin to deep red wine everywhere if not careful. I personally pour them over the sink so that I can even rinse the jars off once secured with a lid and ring prior to putting them in the back of my fridge for at least 5 days.
- The longer you pickle them for, the deeper, darker, and sweeter the eggs will get. I've left mine in for much longer than any recipe will suggest and still live, but they around day 3 I believe you will begin to see diminished egg white, with the yolk penetrated completely after 1 week.
- Try using these as the eggs in a deviled eggs recipe, they are phenominal that way!
